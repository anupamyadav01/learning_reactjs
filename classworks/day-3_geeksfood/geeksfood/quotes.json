    "quote": "The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. Your calling isn’t something that somebody can tell you about. It’s what you feel. It is the thing that gives you juice. The thing that you are supposed to do. And nobody can tell you what that is. You know it inside yourself."

    "author": "Walt Disney",
    "quote": "All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them. The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. The more you like yourself, the less you are like anyone else, which makes you unique."

    "author": "Steve Jobs",
    "quote": "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it."

    "author": "Nelson Mandela",
    "quote": "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."

    "author": "Martin Luther King Jr.",
    "quote": "The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that."

  {
    "author": "Coco Chanel",
    "quote": "The most courageous act is still to think for yourself. Aloud. A girl should be two things: who and what she wants. Success is most often achieved by those who don’t know that failure is inevitable."

    "author": "Vincent Van Gogh",
    "quote": "I am seeking, I am striving, I am in it with all my heart. If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced. Normality is a paved road: it’s comfortable to walk, but no flowers grow."

    "author": "Ralph Waldo Emerson",
    "quote": "What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us. Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year."
  },
  {
    "author": "Helen Keller",
    "quote": "Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved. The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart."

  {
    "author": "Dalai Lama",
    "quote": "Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions. Remember that sometimes not getting what you want is a wonderful stroke of luck. In the practice of tolerance, one's enemy is the best teacher."

    "author": "Stephen Hawking",
    "quote": "Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special."

    "author": "Malala Yousafzai",
    "quote": "We realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced. Let us pick up our books and our pens, they are the most powerful weapons. One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. With guns, you can kill terrorists, with education you can kill terrorism."

    "author": "Rumi",
    "quote": "You were born with wings, why prefer to crawl through life? The wound is the place where the Light enters you. Respond to every call that excites your spirit. Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray."

  {
    "author": "Leonardo da Vinci",
    "quote": "Learning never exhausts the mind. It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things. Life is pretty simple: You do some stuff. Most fails. Some works. You do more of what works. If it works big, others quickly copy it. Then you do something else. The trick is the doing something else."

    "author": "William Shakespeare",
    "quote": "Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none. All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts. To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man."

  {
    "author": "Pablo Picasso",
    "quote": "Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up. The chief enemy of creativity is good sense. I am always doing that which I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it."

  {
    "author": "Anne Frank",
    "quote": "How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world. Think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy. I don’t think of all the misery but of the beauty that still remains. It’s really a wonder that I haven’t dropped all my ideals because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet I keep them, because in spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart."

  {
    "author": "J.K. Rowling",
    "quote": "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities. The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have the power to imagine better."

  {
    "author": "Mother Teresa",
    "quote": "Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless. Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies."
  },
  {
    "author": "Confucius",
    "quote": "It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop. Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. Real knowledge is to know the extent of one’s ignorance."
  },
  {
    "author": "George Bernard Shaw",
    "quote": "Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself. The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place. A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing."

  {
    "author": "Audrey Hepburn",
    "quote": "The beauty of a woman is not in a facial mode but the true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It is the caring that she lovingly gives the passion that she shows. The beauty of a woman grows with the passing years."

  {
    "author": "Friedrich Nietzsche",
    "quote": "He who has a why to live can bear almost any how. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music."

  {
    "author": "Abraham Lincoln",
    "quote": "In the end, it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years. Whatever you are, be a good one. Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other."
  },
  {
    "author": "Winston Churchill",
    "quote": "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts. Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference. The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty."

  {
    "author": "Stephen Covey",
    "quote": "Live out of your imagination, not your history. Be proactive; not reactive. Seek first to understand, then to be understood. The key is not to prioritize what’s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities."

  {
    "author": "Bruce Lee",
    "quote": "Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."
